# webdev
I am learning Web Development through an online course.

The code I am putting here will initially be my code from an online course from developedbyed.com.

I have currently gone through the HTML and CSS course and am starting on JavaScript.

After I finish the courses and have my follow along tutorial code uploaded here I plan on creating and launching
my own website as my portfolio.
