My Todo List Website.

Netlify deployment link: https://happy-ptolemy-e70485.netlify.app/

This is a simple todo list creation tool I made from an online course.

The functionality implemented:
- Adding todo's to the list
- Marking todo list items as completed
- Removing todo list items
- Animations
- Filtering the todo list by completed, uncompleted, or all
- Storing the todo list in local storage so that the items are saved on reload
